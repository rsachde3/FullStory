FullStory Coding

Write a function in any language that multiplies any two integers without using the multiplication or division operators. Aim for the most the elegant code you can. We've done this problem ourselves several times, and there's a big difference between your first attempt and how nice it can look after you try to simplify it. That said, be assured that there's no "gotcha" aspect to this question – no obscure trick that you either discover or not – and no particular "right" formulation. We just want to know what you think "elegant" code looks like.

To Test: Run the test file to test both multiplication functions

To Run with custom inputs, run the main file (set to multiply with recursion)
